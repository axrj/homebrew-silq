# Axrj Silq

Homebrew formula to install [silq](https://github.com/eth-sri/silq)

## How do I install these formulae?

Due to lack of tags in the source repo, I've pinned the formula to a specific commit and hence the --HEAD option is needed 

`brew install --HEAD axrj/silq/silq`

Or `brew tap axrj/silq` and then `brew install --HEAD silq`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
